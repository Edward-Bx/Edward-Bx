- 👋 Hi, I’m @Edward-Bx
- 👀 I’m interested in TypeScript (Vue and StencilJS), Rust, AWS, GitHub actions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust mostly in my free time. During work hours I'm mostly working in TypeScript and doing stuff in AWS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really if it's written in TS or Rust. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love reading literature, playing chess, and since a few years I've been really enjoying playing the piano and I take piano lessons every week!
